Thank you for using Ironmon-Tracker!

This tool requires the Bizhawk emulator v2.8 or greater. Other versions have had issues and are not supported.

USAGE:
1. Load your ROM (Only Emerald & FRLG are supported)
2. In Bizhawk, click Tools -> Lua Console
3. In the Lua Console, click the Open Script icon, and open ironmon_tracker.lua

To edit the Ironmon-Tracker configuration, open ironmon_settings.lua in any text editor.
That file has a description of each option, including button mappings for controller.
